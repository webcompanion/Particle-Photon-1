# Particle-Photon

These are my example files for controlling a Particle Photon device

Purchase the Particle Photon at http://www.particle.io/

My demonstration of how to use this device can be found at http://www.youtube.com/c/johnsdiyplayground

Note that the HTML file requires you to add in your Device ID and Access Token (find yours on the Particle web site)
